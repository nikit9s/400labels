#Formation of a structured set of cardiological
data for their intellectual analysis
The developed software is intended for
formation of a database of structured data generated during
time of appointment with a cardiologist. Formed set
structured data will be used for
data mining for condition assessment
patients and predicting the development of cardiovascular diseases
vascular system.Assessment and forecasting of risks will allow
resolve the issue of timely provision of specialized
medical care (ambulance,
polyclinic medical care, inpatient medical
help). The software can be used in
practice of cardiologists, arrhythmologists on inpatient and
outpatient management of patients.Widespread use of information and telecommunication
technologies in the field of medicine implies the presence of a stationary
computer or mobile computing device with access to
database of patients and examinations at each workplace. IN
under such conditions, the performance of routine procedures related, for example, to
by introducing textual data, it is advisable to simplify as much as possible and
protect as much as possible from possible erroneous input, and
to assign the formation of a structured data set to
computer program.Use of such software
will increase efficiency increase the speed of work
specialist, get rid of a number of errors associated with "human
factor", to release the doctor from performing routine actions and in
as a whole will allow to form data sets for subsequent
intellectual analysis by machine learning methods.
